xliff_export_documents: >-
    If you want to translate eg. the whole /en tree to a different language, first
    create a copy of the /en tree. Afterwards use the copied tree in the export
    and select the source language 'en' and the target language 'de'. When
    importing the translated XLIFF file, the contents of the exported documents
    (in this case the copied tree documents) will be overwritten by the German
    translations in the XLIFF file.
xliff_export_objects: >-
    Only fields inside a Localized Fields container are recognized. When importing
    the translated XLIFF the source language will be untouched, only the target
    language fields will be overwritten. Use Relations checkbox to include Objects
    & Documents from Dependencies e.g. Relation fields, Properties etc.
xliff_export_notice: >-
    Here you can select the documents and objects you want to export for external
    translation.
xliff_import_notice: >-
    Select a translated XLIFF file which was previously exported by pimcore and
    then translated by a localization service provider (LSP) or by a CAT
    application. Please aware that the import will overwrite the elements which
    were selected by the import (read also export).
